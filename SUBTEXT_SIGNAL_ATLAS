To absolutely capture the concept of **Subtext**—specifically the translation of *raw audio* into *human insight*—the most critical companion to your PRD is not a technical spec or a pitch deck.

It is **The Psychometric Signal Atlas**.

While the PRD defines *what* we are building, the **Signal Atlas** defines the "language" the software speaks. It is the "Rosetta Stone" that translates engineering metrics (Hertz, Decibels, Milliseconds) into psychological states (Anxiety, Dominance, Deception).

Without this document, developers will just build a transcription tool. **With** this document, they will build an emotional intelligence engine.

# Document: The Subtext Signal Atlas (v1.0)

**Purpose:** To map bio-acoustic markers to psychological probabilities. This serves as the "Rulebook" for the AI analysis layer and the "Design Guide" for the UI/UX visualization.

## 1\. The Temporal Dimension (Time & Silence)

*The silence is often louder than the noise.*

| The Signal | The Metric (Engineering) | The Subtext (Psychology) | Visual Output (UI/WorkAdventure) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Truth Gap** | Latency \> 800ms between *Question End* and *Answer Start*. | **Cognitive Load:** The speaker is calculating, not recalling. High probability of fabrication or hesitation. | **UI:** A yellow "gap" marker in the timeline.<br>**WA:** Avatar pauses animation/freezes. |
| **The Steamroll** | Overlap Duration \> 2s + Volume differential \> +10dB (Speaker A vs B). | **Dominance/Aggression:** Speaker A is not listening; they are conquering the airtime. | **UI:** The waveform turns jagged Red.<br>**WA:** Avatar scale increases slightly (looming). |
| **The Dead Air** | Silence \> 5s in a group \> 3 people. | **Disengagement/Friction:** The "Awkward Silence." Group cohesion is failing. | **UI:** Background heatmap turns cold Grey/Blue.<br>**WA:** Room lighting dims or turns blue. |

## 2\. The Spectral Dimension (Pitch & Tone)

*It’s not what you said, it’s how you said it.*

| The Signal | The Metric (Engineering) | The Subtext (Psychology) | Visual Output (UI/WorkAdventure) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Micro-Tremor** | High "Jitter" (cycle-to-cycle frequency variation) in short bursts. | **Stress/Deception:** The vocal cords are tightening due to fight-or-flight response. | **UI:** A "pulse" icon overlay on the transcript.<br>**WA:** Avatar vibrates/shakes slightly. |
| **The Monotone** | Flat Pitch Variance (\< 10% deviation) over \> 30s. | **Burnout/Apathy:** The speaker has "checked out" emotionally. | **UI:** Text fades to a lower opacity.<br>**WA:** Avatar becomes semi-transparent (ghosting). |
| **The Uptick** | Rising intonation at the end of declarative sentences (Upspeak). | **Submissiveness/Insecurity:** Seeking validation rather than stating facts. | **UI:** Small question mark icons next to periods.<br>**WA:** Avatar looks around/shrinks. |

## 3\. The Contextual Dimension (Environment & Vibe)

*The invisible "Third Participant" in the meeting.*

| The Signal | The Metric (Engineering) | The Subtext (Context) | Visual Output (UI/WorkAdventure) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Echo Chamber** | High Reverb + Distant Mic Input. | **Low Professional Presence:** Implies a large, empty room or lack of dedicated equipment. | **UI:** Tag as "Low Fidelity Presence." |
| **The Coffee Shop** | Background Noise Class: "Chatter/Clatter" (via `DeepFilterNet`). | **Distracted/Public:** The user is likely multitasking or feels exposed. | **WA:** Spawn a coffee cup icon above the avatar. |

## Why this document is critical for our "Blue Ocean"

1.  **For the AI Engineers:** They don't need to be psychologists. They just need to code the logic: `IF latency > 800ms THEN trigger_event('truth_gap')`. This document gives them the logic.
2.  **For the UI Designers:** It solves the "Invisible Interface" problem. How do you visualize "sarcasm"? This Atlas tells them (e.g., mismatch between *Text Sentiment* (Positive) and *Audio Tone* (Flat)).
3.  **For the Brand:** This document *is* your IP. Competitors have speech-to-text; you have **Speech-to-State**.
